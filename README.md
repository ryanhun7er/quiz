## About
* This is a personal quiz about me! If you don't know me that well yet, you might not get the high score, but have fun guessing!

## How to Use
* At the start screen, you have two choices: (1) Play Game or (2) See High Scores
* After selecting "Play Game" the question will load and the timer begins! You will have 60 seconds to answer all questions. However, if you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. But, if you answer correctly, 10 seconds will be added!
* At the end of the quiz you can enter your name and submit for the leaderboard.
